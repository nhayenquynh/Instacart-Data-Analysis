## Instacart Data Analysis

# Project description:
For this project, you’ll work with data from Instacart.
Instacart is a grocery delivery platform where customers can place a grocery order and have it delivered to them, similar to how Uber Eats and Door Dash work. This particular dataset was publicly released by Instacart in 2017 for a Kaggle competition.

The dataset we've provided for you has been modified from the original. We've reduced the size of the dataset so that your calculations run faster and we’ve introduced missing and duplicate values. We were also careful to preserve the distributions of the original data when we made our changes.

Your mission is to clean up the data and prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers. After answering each question, write a brief explanation of your results in a markdown cell of your Jupyter notebook.
This project will require you to make plots that communicate your results. Make sure that any plots you create have a title, labeled axes, and a legend if necessary; and include plt.show() at the end of each cell with a plot.

# Questions to be answered: 
Must complete all to pass
1. Is there a difference in 'order_hour_of_day' distributions on Wednesdays and Saturdays? Plot the histograms for both days on the same plot and describe the differences that you see.
2. Plot the distribution for the number of orders that customers place (e.g. how many customers placed only 1 order, how many placed only 2, how many only 3, and so on…)
3. What are the top 20 products that are ordered most frequently (display their id and name)?

Must complete at least two to pass
1. How many items do people typically buy in one order? What does the distribution look like?
2. What are the top 20 items that are reordered most frequently (display their names and product IDs)?
3. For each product, what proportion of its orders are reorders (create a table with columns for the product ID, product name, and reorder proportion)?
4. For each customer, what proportion of their products ordered are reorders?
5. What are the top 20 items that people put in their carts first (display the product IDs, product names, and number of times they were the first item added to the cart)?
